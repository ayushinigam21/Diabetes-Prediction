# Diabetes-Prediction
Using machine learning, this program identifies diabetes in patients by analyzing predefined characteristics. Its objective is to classify the Indian PIMA dataset for diabetes and predict whether a person is a diabetic or not. Additionally, it aims to identify the most indicative features of diabetes.

The diabetes prediction model in this project utilizes machine learning techniques. The dataset, which contains predefined characteristics of patients, is divided into two sets: the training set and the test set. The training set is used to train the model by exposing it to the input data and the corresponding known diabetes labels. The model learns patterns and relationships within the data to make predictions. Once the model is trained, it is evaluated on the test set to measure its performance and generalization ability. The test set contains new, unseen data, and the model's predictions are compared with the actual diabetes labels to assess its accuracy. The train and test splitting method ensures that the model's performance is validated on independent data, helping to avoid overfitting and provide a more realistic assessment of its predictive capabilities.
